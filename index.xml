      <description>AWS CodeBuild is managed service for helping continuous integration and deployment. In CodeBuild, we normally use managed container image provided Amazon, it contains almost runtimes like android, dotnet, golang and more. We&amp;rsquo;re usually satisfied the managed image, but sometimes need to use custom image you build, CodeBuild can run on it.
When debugging in CodeBuild, we can log in the container running by codebuild, it&amp;rsquo;s very convenience. To use the function, we set codebuild-breakpoint in buildspec file.</description>

      <description>I have one of the best movies, it&amp;rsquo;s The Equalizer. Thanks to this movie, I knew Denzel Washington, and he became my favorite actor. In this movie, one sentence shook my heart.
 Progress. Not Perfection.
 Denzel Washington is a main character. His colleague aiming to be a cop needs to lose weight, but he tried to eat chips which he hid into sandwich, and Denzel Washington told him it.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel real yet. It is very special day today, off course it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean tacos&#39; day. Maybe, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe and feel it real until I see it by my own eyes. Wow, this is so poetical.</description>

      <description>It is the special day in my family today. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Taco Sunday&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Taco Tuesday&amp;rdquo;? I don&amp;rsquo;t know it. We eat a more huge tacos than it sold by normal restaurant, off course we cook it by ourselves. A bowl full of mined meat, fresh lettuce, salsa source to change the taste, and shredded cheese. I had a great time, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best this weekdays.</description>

      <description>I watched &amp;ldquo;Attack on Titan&amp;rdquo; season 1 with my wife. Characters are attractive, and their dialogue shake our hearts. Maybe, we will watch all seasons through this weekend.
  I cooked packaged instant ramen for the first time because I always eat cup of instant ramen. In addition to cook according to description of package, I made boiled egg, cut a green onion, and attached a seaweed. It was so great.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using terraform in my company, and I like it. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to memorize all expressions of terraform to use it because of IDE&amp;rsquo;s auto complement function. In addition, sometimes I want to test some expressions quickly. terraform console can help it.
&amp;gt; terraform console &amp;gt; [for s in [&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c&amp;#34;] : upper(s)] [ &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;B&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;, ] It is convenience for check values of data and resources because this command can read values in current tfstate.</description>

      <description>It is rare case, but sometimes I have to configure base image by command argument while executing docker build. For example, there are two AWS account, and I use base image contained in each ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for each account. Even I have two base image, but I should use only one Dockerfile. In this case, this solution help me.
 Dockerfile  ARG BASE_IMAGEFROM${BASE_IMAGE}:latestRUN hogehoge Command  $ docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=XXXXXXXX.</description>

      <description>Working at night makes me high, maybe a lot of adrenaline are created by my brain. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate high productivity. Coming dawn, I reviewed progress of yesterday, I found some mistakes in minute. Shut down our laptop, and we have to go to bed as soon as possible.
  Reporting is not just for your boss, but also for yours. In summarizing the report, we can organize that we think.</description>

      <description>I add new function for posting this blog, it is an auto deployment by GitHub Actions. I found some convenient actions helping to update GitHub Pages, and could create deployment configuration easily. However, deployment in GitHub Pages has not been finished from now yet (Maybe, it is not related with these actions). It spent over an hour in Page Build phase. I give up to make sure of finish today.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I would like to switch user.name and user.email of git configuration. For example, I have two GitHub account, for business and for private. When I push some commits to repositories through the same laptop, name and email must be configured correctly for appropriate repository.
In this case, we should set up user configuration for each repository. We can use below commands.
$ cd YOUR_REPOSITORY $ git config --local user.name &amp;#34;hogehoge&amp;#34; $ git config --local user.</description>

      <description>I was talking with my friend from college. Topics are almost about our job. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of opportunity that we talk about serious topics, so it was valuable time for me. Spending over 30 years, the timing I think deeply about my job absolutely comes. Maybe, we&amp;rsquo;re in the timing.
  I pre-ordered Biomutant. I can not wait to play it. Absolutely, my character will be in the dark side.</description>

      <description> For characteristic of my job, I almost have a lot of task to do, so each task tends to be delayed. I frequently say sorry because of sense of guilt. This is also my bad habit. I will say no sorry from now anytime.  </description>

      <description>Standing on weight scale, amazing numerical value appeared. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. Of course, I know what be not enough for me. I know, I know. Then now, I&amp;rsquo;m drinking a canned chu-hai. I will do my best from tomorrow.
  I miss to play basketball. Because of coronavirus, almost sports centers and gymnasium are forbidden to use. The only method to shake off my sorrow is watching NBA game.</description>

      <description>I watched Sicario: Day of the Soldado. To tell the truth, I had begun watching it before I watched the first one, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand background of characters, and stopped watching. After I watched first one, it caught my attention. Sicario series seems to have three titles, and this second one had dramatic ending hinting the story of third one. I cannot wait next.</description>

      <description>  I watched Sicario. Landscape and color usage are incredible. Especially, the scene I remained in my heart is that soldiers walking in sunset.
  It was moist day today, I wanted to dive in the sea without clothes.

      <description>I often tweet by Twitter. My tweet topics contain Tech, NBA, News, and soliloquy, but they&amp;rsquo;re not related in this blog.
The idea was born, and knead words I know. Finally, when considered sentence is ready for tweet, I think why I tweet. While writing sentence, I had no doubt that this tweet must be cool, but finished writing, I noticed the sentence seems like meaningless. What I want to say is that tweet is difficult.</description>

I know the reason, it&amp;rsquo;s Golden Week Syndrome, other calls May Syndrome. I want to rest my body and brain with fluffy bed all day.

      <description>When we find solution which solves something big problem, it is important that we firstly define As-Is and To-Be. In my case, I sometime forget it and find concrete solution first. I understand it is my bad habit.
Today, I realized that I&amp;rsquo;m in the situation, and I wrote this blog to not forget this.
I want to let you know my KIMOCHI.</description>

      <description>AWS Systems Manager can manage instances by Fleet Manager. It can cover not only aws instances, but also on-premiss instances by Hybrid Activations. For example, using Hybrid Activations and managing servers which are under control of auto-scaling function in on-premiss environment, some servers become ConnectionLost status in Fleet Manager when their servers are terminated by scale in action. At result, unused servers continue existing in Fleet Manager.
To resolve that problem, I regularly clean up unused instances by below lambda function.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s important to go outside for refresh. In coronavirus crisis, I&amp;rsquo;m working in my house, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have opportunity to get some fresh air if I have no plan to go out. Being in the house all day, I get crazy like a mob in Bloodborne.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we welcomed a new family member.
It was at 08:00 pm when he came to home with his driver. As soon as he arrived, he began walking all over the house without saying hello. I felt him rude. But I noticed that there is no trash behind the way he walked. He was the professional.
This is him.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am waneal. This is my first blog post. From now on, I will post various types of blogs.
The aim of this blog is to learn English. I usually read English texts to understand specification of some tools, but not write. Generally, living in Japan, we do not use english to let someone know something, and so I want to make a habit of using English. For the people usually using english, it is so easy to post a short English blog.</description>
