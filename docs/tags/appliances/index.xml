      <description>Yesterday, we welcomed a new family member.
It was at 08:00 pm when he came to home with his driver. As soon as he arrived, he began walking all over the house without saying hello. I felt him rude. But I noticed that there is no trash behind the way he walked. He was the professional.
This is him.</description>
