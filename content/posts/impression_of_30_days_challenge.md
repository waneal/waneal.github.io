I have completed my 30 days challenge today. My challenge is writing blog post in English continuous 30 days, I don't mind of genres for blog. English is my second language, so it is not easy for me to write even only a sentence. I sometimes wrote half-assed posts, especially in 2nd half. However, I'm proud of what I could finish this challenge and break my psychological wall to write English.


Blog posts by categories is below. Tech post were written more than I expected, it's a good sign.

- 6 tech posts
- 24 diary posts

Finally, I have finish this 30 days challenge since today, but I will continue to write an English post. Also, I'm going to try next 30 days challenge. Thank you for reading.
