 I watched [Sicario: Day of the Soldado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicario:_Day_of_the_Soldado). To tell the truth, I had begun watching it before I watched the first one, so I couldn't understand background of characters, and stopped watching. After I watched first one, it caught my attention. Sicario series seems to have three titles, and this second one had dramatic ending hinting the story of third one. I cannot wait next.
