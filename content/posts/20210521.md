- I was talking with my friend from college. Topics are almost about our job. I don't have a lot of opportunity that we talk about serious topics, so it was valuable time for me. Spending over 30 years, the timing I think deeply about my job absolutely comes. Maybe, we're in the timing.

- I pre-ordered [Biomutant](https://www.biomutant.com/en/). I can not wait to play it. Absolutely, my character will be in the dark side.
