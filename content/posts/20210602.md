I have one of the best movies, it's [The Equalizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Equalizer_(film)). Thanks to this movie, I knew Denzel Washington, and he became my favorite actor. In this movie, one sentence shook my heart.

> Progress. Not Perfection.

Denzel Washington is a main character. His colleague aiming to be a cop needs to lose weight, but he tried to eat chips which he hid into sandwich, and Denzel Washington told him it. 

This blog continues to be posted 25 days until now, but not every post doesn't always have enough sentences. However, I have completed to write every day until now. This is progress.

Wow, this is so poetical.
