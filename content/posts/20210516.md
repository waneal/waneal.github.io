I often tweet by Twitter. My tweet topics contain Tech, NBA, News, and soliloquy, but they're not related in this blog. 

The idea was born, and knead words I know. Finally, when considered sentence is ready for tweet, I think why I tweet. While writing sentence, I had no doubt that this tweet must be cool, but finished writing, I noticed the sentence seems like meaningless. What I want to say is that tweet is difficult.
