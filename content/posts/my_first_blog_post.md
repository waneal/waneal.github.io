Hi, I am waneal. This is my first blog post. From now on, I will post various types of blogs.

The aim of this blog is to learn English. I usually read English texts to understand specification of some tools, but not write. Generally, living in Japan, we do not use english to let someone know something, and so I want to make a habit of using English. For the people usually using english, it is so easy to post a short English blog. On the other hand, for me, it is tough like trying new computer language because we need to research each idiom, word and further grammar. If I make a habit of using English, I will be the man using english well. That's why I made this blog. 

Thank you for reading.
