It is the special day in my family today. It's a "Taco Sunday". "Taco Tuesday"? I don't know it. We eat a more huge tacos than it sold by normal restaurant, off course we cook it by ourselves. A bowl full of mined meat, fresh lettuce, salsa source to change the taste, and shredded cheese. I had a great time, I'll do my best this weekdays.
