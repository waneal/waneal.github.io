Through this weekday, I'm exhausted. I slept 7 hours yesterday, but I felt not getting satisfied sleep when I get up today. Fatigue is still living in my body. I know the reason, it's Golden Week Syndrome, other calls May Syndrome. I want to rest my body and brain with fluffy bed all day. 

Good night.
