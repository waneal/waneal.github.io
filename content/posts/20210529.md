- I watched "Attack on Titan" season 1 with my wife. Characters are attractive, and their dialogue shake our hearts. Maybe, we will watch all seasons through this weekend.

- I cooked packaged instant ramen for the first time because I always eat cup of instant ramen. In addition to cook according to description of package, I made boiled egg, cut a green onion, and attached a seaweed. It was so great.
