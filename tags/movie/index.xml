      <description>I watched Sicario: Day of the Soldado. To tell the truth, I had begun watching it before I watched the first one, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand background of characters, and stopped watching. After I watched first one, it caught my attention. Sicario series seems to have three titles, and this second one had dramatic ending hinting the story of third one. I cannot wait next.</description>

      <description>  I watched Sicario. Landscape and color usage are incredible. Especially, the scene I remained in my heart is that soldiers walking in sunset.
  It was moist day today, I wanted to dive in the sea without clothes.
